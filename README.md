For this exam I did the fasical reconignition. For this lab i used the lesson taught in class and expanded it to reconigize two people.
due to many issues using the opencv with my raspberry pi i have to use my laptop in order for open CV to work.

This presented many other issues like reinstalling all the software and programs for it to work. 

I was unable to get streams to work on my laptop so i have attached screen captures of the project and added them to a word document.

The facisal reconigtion program uses 3 seperate programs, this allows the software to take 30 pictures of each user. These pictures are ten run through the second piece of software and this program will actually learn to recognize the person. Once the first two programs have executes the third peice of code will take the informaiton of the first two and identify the people who are in the frame. 

In The dropbox submission for this folderf will contain the links for the video of my final project nad a submission video that zack has preapired. Due to us only having one set of hardware i was unable to make my own video. Our final project was a automatic syringe pump based around the drug rituimab. We used a raspberry pi based system that contorlled a ardiuno nano embedded contorller to move a stepper motor. In the video i taslk about how it works.
